# üîê [Password Generator](https://izaack89.github.io/password-generator/)

The password Generator works according to the needs of the user so depening on some criterias the password can have lowercase,uppercase, special characters and/or numbers and the length also depend on the user so it can be from at least of 8 characters or lower of 128 characters. With this conditions the password will be very strong

## Using the system

The system in order to display a password it follow the next steps:

![Password Generator System](./readmeFiles/start.png)

1. Enter the length that will be between 8 and 128 characters. Like the Follow image ![Prompt Length](./readmeFiles/prompt_correct.png)
2. On this part of the system you can decide if you want that the password have lowercase characters ![LowerCase](./readmeFiles/confirm_msg_lower.png)
3. On this part of the system you can decide if you want that the password have uppercase characters ![UpperCase](./readmeFiles/confirm_msg_upper.png)
4. On this part of the system you can decide if you want that the password have special characters ![Special Characters](./readmeFiles/confirm_msg_specialCharacter.png)
5. On this part of the system you can decide if you want that the password have numeric characters ![Numeric](./readmeFiles/confirm_msg_numbers.png)
6. When all or any criteria is selected the system will display the password generated [Password](./readmeFiles/passwordResult.png)

## Errors Handlers

I added 3 features that will prevent that the system crash and are the follow:

1. When on the first step , if you set a length than is lower of 8 or greatest of 128 or if is null, the system will display this error and will show again the message until a valid lenght is enter
   ![Error Handler 1](./readmeFiles/error_handler1.png)

2. If none of the password criteria are selected the system will display this error and it will create a loop until one or more criterias are selected
   ![Error Handler 2](./readmeFiles/error_handler2.png)

3. Before to display the password I do a substr function in order to get the length that was enter by the beggining
